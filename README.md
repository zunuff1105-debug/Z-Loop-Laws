# Z-Loop Laws

## Overview
Z-Loop Laws propose a minimal, domain-agnostic framework for analyzing causal systems where
linear cause–effect models fail due to delayed feedback, saturation, or internal loop closure.

The framework does not introduce new physical forces or entities.
It formalizes observable causal loops under bounded temporal scales.

## Core Contributions
- Three causal laws describing loop formation, saturation collapse, and latency.
- A falsifiable scope limited to systems with feedback cycles under 1000 years.
- Mathematical formulation compatible with dynamical systems theory.
- Empirical illustration using the Universe 25 behavioral collapse experiment.

## What This Is
- A causal analysis framework
- A structural lens for complex systems
- A falsifiable, bounded model

## What This Is Not
- A theory of consciousness
- A cosmological model
- A claim of universal truth
- An AGI or AI architecture
